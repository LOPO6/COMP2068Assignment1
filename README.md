This is an api program I was working on for a school project. Its all about shoes. Users can add, edit and delete shoes from the api. They are also able to call an individual or all the items in the api. 

Swagger code: http://localhost:3000/shoes-api-docs/. 

(Please note that api-docs will only run if the api is running on local server)
